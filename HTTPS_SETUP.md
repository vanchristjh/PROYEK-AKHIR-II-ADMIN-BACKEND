# Using HTTPS with Laravel Development Server

You've successfully installed mkcert and created SSL certificates for local development. There are several ways to use these certificates with your Laravel application:

## Option 1: Use PHP's built-in server directly

```powershell
cd "D:\SEMUA TENTANG KULIAH\SEMESTER 4\PA2\IMPLEMENTASI NEW\sman1-girsip"
php -S localhost:8090 -t public
```

This will run the application on HTTP. Since your mkcert certificates are trusted by your system, you can access your application at http://localhost:8090 and it will be trusted by your browser.

## Option 2: Use a local development environment

Consider using one of these tools that support HTTPS out of the box:
- [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) - A complete development environment for Windows
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) - Configure Apache to use your certificates
- [Valet for Windows](https://github.com/cretueusebiu/valet-windows) - Similar to Laravel Valet but for Windows

## Option 3: Use a reverse proxy like Caddy

[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is a modern web server that automatically handles HTTPS:

1. [Download Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/download)
2. Create a file called `Caddyfile` with:
```
localhost:8090 {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8000
    tls certificates/localhost.pem certificates/localhost-key.pem
}
```
3. Run Laravel with `php artisan serve --port=8000`
4. Run Caddy in another terminal with `caddy run`
5. Access your site at https://localhost:8090

The certificates you created with mkcert are in the `certificates` folder:
- Certificate: `certificates/localhost.pem`
- Key: `certificates/localhost-key.pem`

You've properly configured your Laravel application to use HTTPS by updating the APP_URL in your .env file to:
```
APP_URL=https://localhost:8090
```

This way, all URLs generated by Laravel will use HTTPS.
